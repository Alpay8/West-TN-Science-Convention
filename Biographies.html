Jeri Ryan portrays Seven of Nine, a human who was assimilated by the Borg. When Captain Janeway severs Seven of Nine's link to the Borg Collective, 
she is forced to remain on the U.S.S. Voyager and adapt to human society. Now, as a crew member of the U.S.S. Voyager, she must try to conform to Starfleet rules and regulations.
 "Seven of Nine is confused by the complexities of human interaction," Ryan explains. "Torn between her past as a Borg and her future as a human, Janeway plays an integral role 
 in helping Seven of Nine adapt to her new reality." Ryan, a self-admitted Army brat, grew up near bases ranging from Germany to Hawaii. She was born in Munich, Germany and after 
 re-locating to bases in Kansas, Maryland, Georgia and Texas, her family settled down in Paduch, Kentucky when she was 11. After graduating from Northwestern University in Chicago 
 as a National Merit Scholar with a B.S. in theater, she came to Los Angeles. As a former series regular on NBC's Dark Skies, Ryan is no stranger to the world of science fiction. 
 She portrayed Juliet, a mysterious government agent who helped in a secret program against hostile extraterrestrials. Prior to landing that role, she guest-starred on several 
 television series including Matlock, Who's the Boss?, Murder, She Wrote, Reasonable Doubts and Diagnosis Murder.
